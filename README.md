# ODIN Recipes
A website for my favorite recipes

What I want on this Project : 
- a cohesive way to navigate to recipe pages 
- to look nice 
- for it to be fully functioning 
- to have all the nuts and bolts 

What I want to learn from this project 
- More comfortable with git hub in general 
- The website actually lauching 
- not having to reference code all the time
