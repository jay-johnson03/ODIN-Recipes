        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1-2 lbs of chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, wings, etc.)</li>
            <li> 2 cups of buttermilk</li>
            <li> 2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li> Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Seasonings:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Seasonings are not a set amount or list. Always choose what you prefer.
                But if you like seasoned food, I recommened you use these seasonings to prevent
                bland(nasty) fried chicken.
            </li>
            <li> Paprika </li>
            <li> Old Bay</li>
            <li> Garlic Powder </li>
            <li> Onion Powder </li>
            <li> Cayenne Pepper </li>
            <li> Salt </li>
            <li> Pepper </li>
            <li> Oregano </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and cover them with buttermilk. Let it marinate for at least 1
                hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
            <li> In another bowl, combine the flour and all the seasonings to your preference.</li>
            <li> Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing any excess to drip off. Dredge each piece in the
                seasoned flour mixture, ensuring it's well coated.
                For extra crispy chicken, you can double-dip by dipping it back into the buttermilk and then again into
                the flour mixture. I highly recommend double dipping.</li>
            <li> Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet or deep fryer to 350째F (175째C).</li>
            <li> Carefully place the coated chicken pieces into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry
                in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li> Fry the chicken for about 12-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through.
                The internal temperature should reach 165째F (75째C).</li>
            <li> Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.
            </li>
            <li> Let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your homemade fried chicken!</li>
        </ul>
